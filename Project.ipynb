    "1. It should involve the use of real data to explore a question of interest to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The data should be analyzed using figures/maps, summary tables as well as statistical methods introduced in Ec 140, 141 or C142. As a rough guide a good project will include 2-3 figures, 2-3 displays of summary or descriptive statistics (e.g., cross-tabs) and the presentation of estimation results from a small collection of econometric models (e.g., OLS or quantile regression fits with different conditioning variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The analysis and write-up should be done in Python using a Jupyter notebook (with all project narrative included in markdown cells). Code should be clearly commented. The write-up should explain the assumptions being invoked to justify the analysis and also include a discussion and interpretation of any results. A clear discussion of the limitations of the analysis and how it might be improved through further work should also be included.\n",

    "4. group projects need to include a few paragraphs explaining each team members specific contributions"
